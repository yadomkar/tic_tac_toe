# AI Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This Tic Tac Toe game, developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum, allows players to enjoy the classic game in a browser setting. With a focus on clean, modular JavaScript, this project demonstrates proficiency in core web development concepts. The game features three difficulty levels for single-player mode against an AI opponent, offering a dynamic gaming experience.

## Learning Points
- **Modular JavaScript Development**: Used factory functions and the module pattern to encapsulate game logic, player management, and display controls.
- **AI Difficulty Levels**: Implemented 'God' and 'Easy' modes for AI, providing varying levels of challenge for the player.
- **DOM Manipulation and Event Handling**: Gained experience in dynamically rendering game states and responding to player interactions.
- **CSS for Interactive UI**: Applied CSS for responsive and engaging user interface design.
- **JavaScript-based Game Logic**: Devised algorithms to check for game status (win, lose, draw) and to control AI behavior.

## Future Enhancements
- Introduce multiplayer support over a network.
- Implement a score tracking system.
- Add customizable player avatars and board themes.
